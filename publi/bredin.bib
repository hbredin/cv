	Abstract = {Modern TV series have complex plots made of several intertwined stories following numerous characters. In this paper, we propose an approach for automatically detecting these stories in order to generate video summaries and we propose a visualization tool to have a quick and easy look at TV series. Based on automatic scene segmentation of each TV series episode (a scene is defined as temporally and spatially continuous and semantically coherent), scenes are clustered into stories, made of (non necessarily adjacent) semantically similar scenes. Visual, audio and text modalities are combined to achieve better scene segmentation and story detection performance. An extraction of salient scenes from stories is performed to create the summary. Experimentations are conducted on two TV series with different formats.},

	Abstract = {We propose an approach for unsupervised speaker identification in TV broadcast videos, by combining acoustic speaker diarization with person names obtained via video OCR from overlaid texts. Three methods for the propagation of the overlaid names to the speech turns are compared, taking into account the co-occurence duration between the speaker clusters and the names provided by the video OCR and using a task-adapted variant of the TF-IDF information retrieval coefficient. These methods were tested on the REPERE dry-run evaluation corpus, containing 3 hours of annotated videos. Our best unsupervised system reaches a F-measure of 70.2\% when considering all the speakers, and 81.7\% if anchor speakers are left out. By comparison, a mono-modal, supervised speaker identification system with 535 speaker models trained on matching development data and additional TV and radio data only provided a 57.5\% F-measure when considering all the speakers and 45.7\% without anchor.},

	Abstract = {Multiple sub-stories usually coexist in every episode of a TV series. We propose several variants of an approach for plot de-interlacing based on scenes clustering -- with the ultimate goal of providing the end-user with tools for fast and easy overview of one episode, one season or the whole TV series. Each scene can be described in three different ways (based on color histograms, speaker diarization or automatic speech recognition outputs) and four clustering approaches are investigated, one of them based on a graphical representation of the video. Experiments are performed on two TV series of different lengths and formats. We show that semantic descriptors (such as speaker diarization) give the best results and underline that our approach provides useful information for plot de-interlacing.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the use of speaker diarization (SD) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) for the segmentation of audiovisual documents into scenes. We introduce multiple monomodal and multimodal approaches based on a state-of-the-art algorithm called generalized scene transition graph (GSTG). First, we extend the latter with the use of semantic information derived from both SD and ASR. Then, multimodal fusion of color histograms, SD and ASR is investigated at various point of the GSTG pipeline (early, late or intermediate fusion). Experiments driven on a few episodes of a popular TV show indicate that SD and ASR can be successfully combined with visual information and bring an additional +11% relative increase in terms of F-Measure for scene boundary detection over the state-of-the-art baseline.},

@article{Ramona2011,
	Abstract = {This paper presents the first public framework for the evaluation of audio fingerprinting techniques. Although the domain of audio identification is very active, both in the industry and the academic world, there is nowadays no common basis to compare the proposed techniques. This is because corpuses and evaluation protocols differ between the authors. The framework we present here corresponds to a use-case in which audio excerpts have to be detected in a radio broadcast stream. This scenario indeed naturally provides a large variety of audio distortions that makes this task a real challenge for fingerprinting systems. Scoring metrics are discussed, with regard to this particular scenario. We then describe a whole evaluation framework including an audio corpus, along with the related groundtruth annotation, and a toolkit for the computation of the score metrics. An example of application of this framework is finally detailed. This took place during the evaluation campaign of the Quaero project. This evaluation framework is publicly available for download and constitutes a simple, yet thorough, platform that can be used by the community in the field of audio identification, to encourage reproducible results.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel approach to perform scene segmentation of TV series. Using the output of our existing speaker diarization system, any temporal segment of the video can be described as a binary feature vector. A straightforward segmentation algorithm then allows to group similar contiguous speaker segments into scenes. An additional visual-only color-based segmentation is then used to refine the first segmentation. Experiments are performed on a subset of the Ally McBeal TV series and show promising results, obtained with a rule-free and generic method. For comparison purposes, test corpus annotations and description are made available to the community.},

	Abstract = {We deal with the issue of combining dozens of classifiers into a better one. Our first contribution is the introduction of the notion of communities of classifiers. We build a complete graph with one node per classifier and edges weighted by a measure of similarity between connected classifiers. The resulting community structure is uncovered from this graph using the state-of-the-art Louvain algorithm. Our second contribution is a hierarchical fusion approach driven by these communities. First, intra-community fusion results in one classifier per community. Then, inter-community fusion takes advantage of their complementarity to achieve much better classification performance. Application to the combination of 90 classifiers in the framework of TRECVid 2010 Semantic Indexing task shows a 30% increase in performance relative to a baseline flat fusion.},
